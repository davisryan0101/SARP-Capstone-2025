 We intend to design the propulsion system for a theoretical Orbital Transfer Vehicle produced by the Society for Advanced Rocket Propulsion. The propulsion elements of this project will include a regeneratively cooled liquid bi-propellant rocket engine, augmented spark ignitor (ASI), and the accompanying fluid management system (to control propellant flow into the engine). Electrical system scope will include an engine controller, which will actuate valves, estimate our integrated thrust, determine the correct shutoff timing, and demonstrate the ability to restart the engine remotely after a dwell period set by our mission objective, on top of an onboard instrumentation suite that will monitor engine manifold pressure, propellant temperature, thrust, and acceleration. The structural components of this system will encompass selection of COTS tanks (and any required adaptations) as well as the design of lightweight structures joining the engine to its plumbing and tanks, an electronics panel, and a simplified payload interface. 

The main deliverables of this project are a propulsion system, ready for static engine testing, in addition to a simulation demonstrating mission performance using empirical test data. 

The purpose of this repository is to store and update any and all code used to size, simulate, or analyze parts and subsystems on this project.
